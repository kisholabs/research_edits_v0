\begin{abstract}
With the advent of climate change and global warming, ice sheets worldwide have been melting at an alarming rate. The largest contributor to global ice loss is the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), losing over 215 Gt per yr, and accounting for ~10\% of mean global sea level rise since the 1990s. It is imperative to understand what dynamics are causing this ice loss and influencing ice flow in order to successfully project mass changes of the GrIS and associated sea level rise. Prior research has found that basal tractions, which represent stress on the ice caused by a layer in between the ice and the bedrock, play a fundamental role in controlling ice flow, but there is no way to measure these basal tractions as they are buried deep beneath the surface. Our work applies machine learning, ice thickness data, and satellite radar data to perform a geophysical inversion to quantify the forces and distributions of the basal tractions that are holding the Greenland Ice sheet back from flowing into the ocean. We partitioned Greenland into 1000 grid cells and generated basis functions (body-forces) for each cell (2° x 2°) in order to generate the best linear combination to train our model to predict the velocity of ice flow across GrIS. Applying Least Squares Method (LSM), Ridge and LASSO regularization, and trade-off (L-curve) criterion, we attained a model with an R$^2$ fit of 0.973 with an RMSE of 6.36 and MAE of 4.30. This model found that the coastline basis tractions are responsible for keeping the majority of the ice sheet from flowing into the ocean. Our research produced a novel inversion algorithm to successfully predict the surface horizontal velocity field and associated traction distributions of the basal friction of the GrIS. The results of this work enhance knowledge of ice flow by uncovering relationships between basal traction, velocity fields, and ice flux, providing a new method of associating ice loss with sea level changes.

\section{Introduction}

With the advent of climate change and global warming, ice sheets worldwide have been melting at an alarming rate. The rate of ice mass loss has increased sixfold from 81 billion tons in the 1990’s to 475 billion tons in the 2010s \cite{stocker_climate_2013}. The largest contributor to global ice loss is the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), losing over 215 Gt per yr, and accounting for ~10\% of mean global sea level rise since the 1990s \cite{stocker_climate_2013}. Rising sea levels have a wide array of disastrous impacts, including coastal erosion, storm surges, flooding, disease spread, and habitat loss that will only continue to worsen in a warming climate (Pattyn et al., 2018). It is imperative to understand what dynamics are causing this ice loss and influencing ice flow in order to successfully project mass changes of the GrIS and associated sea level rise.

Recent advances in satellite remote sensing systems have produced high-resolution measurements and models of the GrIS, making them an ideal tool for studying motion across large ice sheets. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites employ backscattered radar waves to produce precise topographical and elevation maps. Two-pass Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (inSAR) satellites use radar observations from multiple trips over an area of interest to determine surface motion. Over the past decade, InSAR technologies have yielded several large-scale ice velocity maps of the GrIS and Antarctic with highly accurate ice dynamics data. 

We focus on two datasets in this work: the ETOPO1 Global Relief Model, published by the NOAA, that provides ice and bedrock topographical surface models for the GrIs, and Ice Velocity maps derived from inSAR satellite imagery taken from the E.S.A's Sentinel 1 satellites as a part of the the Greenland Ice Sheet ECV project. By inverting these datasets through a novel algorithm, we quantify forces and distributions of basal tractions, and horizontal strain rates that are holding the GrIs back from flowing into the ocean. Initial results show significant correlations between inSAR derived flow rates and strain patterns around the coastline of the ice sheet.

\section{Previous Work}

Glaciologists have traditionally classified ice motion as a viscous flow (Morland Steady Flow citation). This motivated prior researchers at Stony Brook university to use the bedrock and ice elevations of the GrIs derived from ETOPO1 topographical data set to generate a gravitational potential energy (GPE) map across the GrIs. The primary focus of the research was establishing a connection between GPE calculations and the rate of viscous ice flow, and thus the researchers assumed that the ice was moving along a frictionless base. However, the GPE velocity calculations vastly overestimated the speeds of the ice velocities by a thousand-fold compared to the ground truth data from inSAR satellite imagery. Thus, prior work has reinforced the notion that the basal traction's between the ice and the bedrock have a major influence over ice motion and ice velocity rates (INSERT CITATION). However, these forces have been poorly characterized as they remain buried beneath thousands of feet of ice.

Our work is motivated by these results, and acts as an extension building on this prior research to capture a relationship between the inSAR derived horizontal velocity rates and the basal tractions of the GrIs in order to gain insight as to what is holding the ice back from flowing into the ocean. Our approach uses a hybrid model: our ground truth velocity data is used to train a linear regression model, and these model coefficients can be fed into a geophysical model to estimate strain rates that capture relationships between the ice motion and physical variables.

\section{Methods}

\subsubsection{Dataset}
Our data comes from two sources: ETOPO1 and Sentinel-1 radar satellite imagery. ETOPO1 provides topographical ice and bedrock elevation measurements which are used to calculate the thickness of the ice, and then generate gravitational potential energies (GPE) across the entire ice sheet. Roughly 1800 Sentinel 1 scenes were used and inSAR feature tracking techniques were applied to derive surface horizontal velocity information of the ice. Both global-level datasets were parsed using the geopandas library to focus on the GrIs from 2016-2017. This data is the foundation for our geophysical equation of our problem:

$$
\vec{d}=\overline{\overline{G}} m=v_{\text {InSAR}}-v_{GPE}
$$

Our goal to find best linear combination $\overline{\overline{G}} m$ that predicts $\vec{d}$. After achieving a proper fit, the model coefficients would be able to provide valuable insight to the distributions of basal tractions, and could also be translated to view the strain rates across the GrIs.

\subsubsection{G matrix}
To create our G matrix, we partitioned Greenland into 1000 grid cells (each with size 2\degree  2*) and generated 3 basis functions (Exx - Horizontal East and West effective body forces, Eyy - Horizontal North and South effective body-forces, and Exy - Shear effective body-forces) for each cell. Our original experiments used 40 grid cells (each 10 x 10), and we noticed considerable performance improvements increasing the resolution of our G matrix. Depending on computational computing power available, further reducing the grid cell size is an avenue for further optimizing the fit of the BLANK linear combination.   

\subsubsection{Model}

This is a linear inversion task, where the effective body-forces in one grid cell can have effects on its surrounding cells and beyond. Thus, it requires a regression model. We use Least Squares Regression from the sklearn library, which has shown to perform well in inversion tasks \cite{lines_review_1984}. To further generalize and optimize the overall fit of our model, we also employed regularization methods Ridge and LASSO. Our Loss Function is defined as [INSERT LOSS HERE], with our alpha value range defined as [alpha]. We used the trade-off (L-curve) criterion and the 10-fold generalized cross validation techniques to determine our optimal smoothing parameter. 

\section{Results}

Both the Ridge and LASSO regression models achieved a near identical fit to the velocity field, achieving R$^${2} values of 0.999 and 0.987 respectively. The model predicted plotted against the ground truth velocity field has been shown in Figure BLANK, highlighting the accuracy of the predictions. The slight errors in the predictions seem to be mostly located along the coastline, and we believe that these errors can be corrected for through a smaller grid cell size and access to higher computing power. 


\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work, we developed an inversion algorithm for quantifying forces and magnitudes of basal tractions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This is achieved via a hybrid model, with a linear regression based inversion model that integrates real-world inSAR data, and a physics-based algorithm to predict strain rates from calculated ice velocity fields. This work has large implications on the ability to individually separate basal traction from GPE, and serves as a step towards modeling ice flux in relation to friction, normal forces, and other nonlinear forces.

(FIX)

In the near future, we aim to make DeepQuake more accurate, generalizable to other regions, and interpretable to
humans. Our approach demonstrates the promise of using AI to predict earthquakes to prevent their
catastrophic impact on climate, potentially saving millions of lives and billions of dollars in damage.

\cite{briner_rate_2020}

This work has large implications on the ability to individually separate basal traction from GPE. It also serves as a step towards modeling ice flux in relation to friction, normal forces, and other nonlinear forces. For example, to quantify the changes in ice flux, we will run multiple inversions and define the velocity field near the edge of Greenland, and we purposely decrease the velocity magnitude by 50\% and that reduced velocity becomes the new data uploaded into the inversion model to get the new basal tractions. We would do a grid search to find a proper velocity field percentage that results in the basal traction reduction.

We are currently looking for more data spanning more time or also for the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
